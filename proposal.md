# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Movie/TV Show Selector

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that will output movie and TV shows for the user to watch. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will, given input from the user, output a TV Show or Movie based on the user's inputed critea. The media will be based off of IMDB's top 100 movies and tv shows of all time.
The user will be able to select from critea like genre, rating (PG13, R, PG, etc.), number of seasons (if a TV Show) and more. This software will use data from IMDB.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Samantha Vassallo - Samantha.vassallo@temple.edu - Zhengkang Fan 
Natalyah Douglass - Natalyah.douglass@temple.edu - Zhengkang Fan 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what we will accomplish a software that will be able to give the user a movie or tv show based off their inputted criteria.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can accomplish using data from IMBD to give the user a list of movies/tv shows that fit what they are searching for. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The BEST outcome and our true hope would be to accomplish what we fully intend to do as stated in question three. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

New skills we will need to acquire would be file creation and implimentation, working with a database, getting better with dictionaries as well. We will definetly need to research what movies and shows to include as well. 
We will all be working together equally, difficult to say who is dedicating themselves to which portion just yet, but we will update this section later on as a sense of organization.
